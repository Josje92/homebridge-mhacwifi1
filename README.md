# homebridge-mhacwifi1
Homebridge plugin for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries AirCon WiFi Controller (MH-AC-WIFI-1)

This plugin is based on the API that is published by the MH-AC-WIFI-1 controller itself (on the LAN), so it DOES NOT work with the airconwithme REST API in the cloud at https://user.airconwithme.com/.
